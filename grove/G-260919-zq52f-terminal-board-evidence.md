# Terminal board G-017: evidence, 2026-09-19

Branch `worktree-W-009`, worktree `.claude/worktrees/W-009`, base `acfc905`
(main). One implementer owned the shared interfaces; a subagent made the
cancellable-read change inside that worktree under review, and two separate
reviewer agents examined the result. Nothing here was merged or pushed.
[G-017](G-017-terminal-picker.md) owns the contract and
acceptance; its [plan](G-021-terminal-picker-plan.md#adjustments-made-while-implementing-2026-09-19)
records each bounded technical adjustment and why.

**What this evidence is not.** Every check below is automated. Nobody has yet
used the board and said whether it is pleasant, legible, or the right first
screen. That judgment is the owner's, from the demo command at the end, and
G-017 stays `active` until it is given.

## Prerequisite

G-014 to G-016 were established in main by Git ancestry, not by status: all
eleven repair and review-fix commits (`d5666dd` `5316dbe` `892a842` `2cc7814`
`dac27fe` `2e18866` `9d11bdb` `9e8430c` `dedac73` `40e882f` `7f02b71`) and the
four closing documentation commits are ancestors of `acfc905`, and
`worktree-W-006-W-008` has no commit missing from main. No G-017
implementation or branch existed. The older worktrees were left untouched.

## Commits

| Commit | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `17e560a` | G-017 set active through `grove update` |
| `188b325` | Cancellable source inspection: `repo.GitContext` and friends, `versions.InspectContext`, `versions.ResolveContext`; the old entrypoints are background wrappers |
| `418ea31` | `versions.Result.GitDir` identifies the invocation's own checkout |
| `522783c` | `internal/tui`: model, rendering, and `Run`; pins Bubble Tea v2.0.9 and x/ansi v0.11.7 |
| `32cf105` | Bare `grove` opens the board; shared workspace result writer; discovery-only project lookup; screen-failure exit; pseudo-terminal harness; README |
| `3904598` | Review fixes: stale chooser row (panic), clipped incomplete warning, lost reason under the sources screen, two assertions that could not fail |
| `184b8c3` | Review fixes: kill delay no longer applies to uncancellable Git calls, no empty Git diagnostic, SIGHUP cancels the session; final code revision |

## Acceptance, by item

1. **Columns from exactly one live source.** `TestBoardComesFromOneLiveSource`
   and `TestContextStates` (fake rows with conflicting titles and statuses),
   and `TestBoardConnectedWorkflow` on a real main/feature repository: main's
   board shows W-001 proposed under main's title; `b` then shows it active
   under the feature title with W-002 in Proposed; branch-only W-002 is on
   main's Other sources shelf with no status; questions never appear; an
   invalid or unidentifiable context says "not an empty board" and draws no
   columns; a valid checkout without work draws four empty columns. `b` calls
   no backend function, and every file under both checkouts and `.git` hashes
   the same afterwards.
2. **Explicit selection.** `TestSelectionIsExplicit`: Enter on a card and Enter
   on the ID header make zero resolver calls; Enter on a version makes exactly
   one, with that row's selector; two rows holding identical bytes stay two
   choices. `TestDeletedRowCannotResolve`. One reviewer's 400-seed random-key
   probe, swapping and reordering results under the model, found no resolver
   call whose selector differed from the focused row's.
3. **Honest refusals.** The connected workflow changes the target after it was
   displayed: `REFUSED: W-001 changed since it was selected` stays through
   navigation until `r`; after refresh the header is focused, Enter selects
   nothing, and explicit reselection resolves and `show` reads the new bytes.
   A committed version whose checkout differs is refused with the resolver's
   reason. The whole walk repeats with an unrelated invalid worktree: the
   INCOMPLETE banner persists on every screen and the chooser refuses that
   checkout with its diagnostic.
4. **Model behavior.** `TestStaleAndCancelledReplies` (old generations, an
   abandoned resolve, a reply for another selector), `TestRefreshFollowsIdentityNotPosition`,
   `TestRefreshUnderOverlays`, `TestQuitAndInterruptCancelTheRead`,
   `TestLayoutAtEverySize` (120x30, 100x24, 99x24, 80x24, 40x10, below minimum,
   resize back; every row exactly the terminal's width, hints never clipped),
   `TestEverythingStaysReachable` (30 cards, 30 shelf items, 26 versions, a
   200-line body, 60 diagnostics, at three sizes), `TestHostileTextIsInert`
   (OSC 52, CSI erase, C1 as rune and as raw byte, CR, a bidirectional
   override, wide and combining characters, newline and tab in paths, on every
   screen; record bytes unchanged).
5. **Terminal.** `internal/tui/testdata/terminal.py`, run by `TestTerminal`
   against a freshly built binary (race-built under `-race`), eight scenarios:
   select and `show` through the binary in plain and JSON form with no
   interface byte on stdout; q, Esc, Ctrl-C from two screens; refusal without
   a terminal in four stream combinations, with help and explicit commands
   unaffected; a Git read blocked after a started-handshake, then q or Ctrl-C
   at startup, refresh, and resolve, with the child's PID gone afterwards; the
   same under SIGHUP; a screen whose far end closes; resize through the
   minimum and back; and the framework's three log switches set with no file
   appearing. Each compares all termios fields before and after and requires
   the alternate screen left and the cursor shown. The repository tree hashes
   the same after every scenario.
6. **Suites and review.** Below.
7. **Default invocation.** `TestBoardInvocation`, `TestBoardRefusesWithoutTerminal`,
   and the harness. A reviewer diffed 35 invocations of the explicit commands
   against a binary built from `acfc905`: stdout and exit codes byte-identical,
   stderr differing only in the usage banner and the `--json` scope message.
   Refusal without a terminal took 4 to 7 ms.

## Verification

Run uncached in the worktree at `184b8c3`, the final code revision:

| Check | Actual result |
| --- | --- |
| `go test -count=1 ./...` | all 7 packages ok (cli 21.9s, create 3.9s, project 0.4s, repo 7.1s, tui 17.9s, update 6.1s, versions 78.8s) |
| `go test -race -count=1 ./...` | all 7 packages ok, no race reported (cli 25.3s, create 5.6s, project 2.1s, repo 8.3s, tui 41.3s with a race-built binary under the pseudo-terminal, update 6.8s, versions 87.6s) |
| `go vet ./...` | clean, exit 0 |
| `gofmt -l .` | no files listed |
| `go run ./cmd/grove check` | `OK: 15 records`, exit 0 (rerun after the record and brief edits: same) |
| `go mod verify`; `go mod tidy` | all modules verified; no diff |
| `python3 internal/tui/testdata/terminal.py BINARY` | eight scenarios ok; a reviewer ran the earlier seven three times without a flake |
| Stray processes | `pgrep -fl "sleep 600"` finds none after the suites |

The same suites passed at `32cf105` before review. Cancellation tests were
written first and failed to compile before the implementation; with the
resolver's guard disabled one failed with `branch refs/heads/feature moved`,
and with the inspection guards disabled one returned a Result carrying bogus
diagnostics. `TestRefreshUnderOverlays` fails without the chooser fix.

## Independent review

Two reviewer agents with fresh context, working read-only with throwaway
probes they deleted, one on selection, derivation, and text safety, one on
cancellation, lifecycle, and the CLI contract. Their findings and dispositions:

| Finding | Severity | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The chooser kept a row index across `r`; fewer checkouts inverted a slice bound and the next frame panicked, or showed no rows | consequential | Fixed in `3904598`: the shared window function clamps, the model clamps on each result; regression fails without it |
| INCOMPLETE clipped to `INC…` at 40 columns during a pending read | minor | Fixed: the warning leads the banner; regression |
| A card vanishing while the sources screen covered its versions lost the reason and Esc opened another card | minor | Fixed; regression. Never a selection risk: refresh had already cleared the version focus |
| A selector-binding assertion decided by the wrong check; a scroll assertion that could not fail at one size | nit | Both replaced |
| The two-second kill delay also bounded uncancellable Git calls: a helper holding Git's output made `versions` fail with `grove: git worktree: ` where `acfc905` succeeded | minor, demonstrated | Fixed in `184b8c3`: only a cancellable context bounds the wait; a silent Git failure reports the failure; regression with a pipe-holding shim |
| SIGHUP left a blocked Git child running and the terminal raw | minor, demonstrated | Fixed: `Run` cancels on SIGHUP; harness scenario |
| `ResolveContext`'s comment overstated what cancellation replaces | nit | Comment corrected |
| The final `ctx.Err()` guard in `inspect` is not the deciding check in any test | nit | Kept as defense; recorded here |
| `RUNEWIDTH_EASTASIAN` is read before `Run` can unset anything | nit | No action: it changes cell widths and writes no file |

Verified sound by the reviewers: no Git execution reachable from the context
entrypoints is unbound; a cancelled call returns neither Result nor Workspace;
`Result.GitDir` does not reach `versions --json`; the invocation checkout is
found through a symlinked path, `--project`, a nested prefix, and a linked
worktree; `reads` and the watched screen are race-free, and `Run` cannot
return a workspace after an interrupt or a dead screen; unsetting the log
switches is effective and load-bearing (without it the harness fails with
`trace.log`); the harness's survivor check does report a surviving child under
SIGKILL; `PENDIN` (0x20000000) is the only termios bit that differs on macOS
and flipping `ECHO` fails the comparison; dependency versions match Bubble
Tea v2.0.9's own requirements.

## Remaining limits

- Owner usability feedback has not happened. Layout, wording, key choices, and
  whether the board is the right first screen are unjudged.
- Unix only in evidence: the pseudo-terminal harness needs `python3` with
  `pty` and `termios`, and is skipped without it. Nothing was run on Windows.
- SIGKILL cannot restore a terminal or collect a child. SIGTERM exits 0
  without output, as the framework's quit. A blocked filesystem call (not
  Git) is not interrupted by cancellation.
- Every refresh and every resolve re-inspects all branch tips and worktrees
  (about 0.6 s for this repository's eight sources when this was written;
  0.24 s after [G-031](G-031-load-scaling.md), which also
  measures large repositories). No polling, watching,
  caching, search, filter, or mouse, by design of this slice.
- Escaping also escapes the joiners inside emoji sequences and non-ASCII
  spaces; they display as `‍` and the like rather than rendering.
- Version rows clip a long source label before its change word at 2/5 width;
  the detail pane shows both in full.
- The board reads only. Record edits, worktree creation, and launching an
  editor, shell, or agent remain separate work, as do claims and runs.

## Integration handoff

Integration into main is a separate, explicit step; G-017 being active or done
asserts the state of this branch only. Demo, from the worktree:

```sh
cd .claude/worktrees/W-009 && go run ./cmd/grove
```

It opens on this checkout's board, where G-017 is Active while main's version
says proposed: Enter on that card shows both. `b` switches the board to main's
live files. Selecting a version prints its project directory after the screen
is restored.
