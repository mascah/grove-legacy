# CLI repairs G-014 to G-016: evidence, 2026-09-19

Branch `worktree-W-006-W-008`, worktree `.claude/worktrees/W-006-W-008`, base
`2d6de36` (main when the work began). One implementer made the three repairs
serially in that order because they share the repository, loader, and CLI
interfaces. Nothing here was merged or pushed. A done record asserts
completion on this branch; integration into main is established by Git
ancestry and remains a separate step.

Each work record owns its acceptance evidence and limits:
[G-014](G-014-workspace-provenance.md),
[G-015](G-015-preserve-updates.md),
[G-016](G-016-git-paths.md). Each plan records the bounded
technical adjustments made while implementing it. This document holds what
belongs to the three together: the commits, the combined verification, and
the review of the combined result. It repairs the defects found by the
[integrated CLI review](G-022-integrated-cli-review.md) (R1 to R6).

## Commits

| Commit | Record | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `d5666dd` | G-014 | Read committed projects two or more levels below the repository root |
| `5316dbe` | G-014 | Verify live project ownership through every prefix component; re-enter checkouts at the second inventory |
| `892a842` | G-014 | Re-check the selected target before returning a workspace |
| `2cc7814` | G-015 | Preserve comments, edit explicit keys, plan flow separators for the whole request |
| `dac27fe` | G-015 | Compare exact configuration bytes in update and creation |
| `2e18866` | G-016 | Ask Git for each path on its own; shared NUL-delimited worktree inventory |
| `9d11bdb` | G-016 | Allocator scans worktrees from that inventory |
| `9e8430c` | G-014 | Review fixes: configuration vanishing during a read, parent-entry filter, CLI proof |
| `dedac73` | G-015 | Review fix: the editor's key-position guard was always true |
| `40e882f` | G-016 | Review fixes: concurrent allocation under odd names; removed a common-directory query (mistaken, see the combined review) |
| `7f02b71` | G-014 | Restores that common-directory check with a regression; final code revision |

## Reproduction before repair

Every failure was reproduced with the retained regression tests before its
fix, on a pristine export of `2d6de36` (G-014, G-016) or on the unfixed branch
(G-015). Observed at the base:

- R1: a feature checkout whose project prefix was an external, intermediate,
  internal, or dangling symlink, or a nested repository, was reported
  `Complete:true` with a valid source attributed to `refs/heads/feature`.
- R2: `workspace --source ... --json` exited 0 with a project path inside a
  checkout deleted before the second inventory.
- R3/R4: the comment in `title: # retain` was deleted; removing the final two
  flow entries failed with `frontmatter: overlapping edits`; `? status` failed
  with `cannot locate the key's colon`.
- R5: a comment-only `grove.yaml` change published an update and created a
  record.
- R6: for a main checkout named `new\nline`, the repository became `.../new`
  and the prefix `line/.git\nsub\nproject/`, both live sources were invalid,
  `lock`, `next-ids`, and `write.lock` appeared under the stray sibling
  `.../new/grove`, and allocation returned 2 instead of 91.

## Combined verification

Run uncached in the repair worktree at `7f02b71`, the final code revision:

| Check | Actual result |
| --- | --- |
| `go test -count=1 ./...` | PASS: cli 14.1s, create 3.9s, project 0.7s, repo 1.6s, update 5.8s, versions 72.2s; the CLI entrypoint has no tests |
| `go test -race -count=1 ./...` | PASS, all six internal packages |
| `go vet ./...` | PASS |
| `gofmt -l cmd internal` | No output |
| `go run ./cmd/grove check` | `OK: 14 records` |
| `git diff 2d6de36 HEAD -- go.mod go.sum` | No change; no dependency added |
| Real use here at `40e882f`: `versions G-014`, then `workspace --source` on this worktree's live selector | Four versions listed; exit 0 and this worktree's path |
| Local Markdown links and anchors | Pass, except links in the predecessor review to `../skills`, which resolve only from the main checkout's depth and are unchanged here |

The versions package takes three to four times as long as at the base (about
21s there). About forty new fixtures each build Git repositories, and each
live checkout now costs more `rev-parse` processes (G-014's limits). Timings
were taken while reviewers ran their own suites on the same machine.

## Independent review

Four reviews by separate reviewer agents, each working from its own export of
the committed range and forbidden to edit the repository. The implementer
wrote none of their probes.

| Scope | Result | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G-014, `2d6de36..892a842` | No P1/P2. Base failures confirmed; five adversarial probes refused | P3s fixed in `9e8430c` |
| G-015, `2cc7814` and `dac27fe` | No P1/P2. 46 adversarial `Edit` probes: correct bytes or a safe refusal | Key guard fixed in `dedac73`; two cosmetic behaviours accepted and recorded in G-015 |
| G-016, `2e18866` and `9d11bdb` | No correctness finding. No remaining newline-unsafe parsing of path-bearing Git output | `40e882f` |
| Combined, `2d6de36..40e882f` | **One P1**, below. Otherwise: selector and `Parse` byte-identical to the base, `versions --json` identical on the same fixture, no CLI source change outside tests, lock order and `*Failure` unchanged, reads write nothing, no scope beyond the three repairs, and every production hunk turns the suite red when reverted | P1 fixed in `7f02b71` |

The combined review's P1: the G-016 review measured the extra Git processes
and called the common-directory query in `enterWorktree` redundant, because
the Git directory must be the common directory or sit directly below
`<common>/worktrees`. `40e882f` removed it. The combined reviewer then built a
separate repository with `git init --separate-git-dir <common>/worktrees/evil`,
registered it by writing its `gitdir` file, and showed it admitted as a valid
live source and returned by `workspace`: the shape of the Git directory
matched and only the common directory differed. That needs a write inside
the repository's Git directory, but it is the defect G-014 exists to prevent,
and G-014's design names the common directory. `7f02b71` restores the check;
`TestInspectForeignRepositoryRegisteredAsWorktree` fails at `40e882f` and
passes now. The same commit removes two unused parameters and an unreachable
guard the review named, and corrects the measured process counts. `7f02b71`
itself was verified by that regression and the suites above; it was not sent
for a fifth review.

## Remaining limits

Per record, in each record's Evidence. Across the three: changes after
`workspace`'s final check and arbitrary writers after update's final
comparison stay outside the guarantees; a checkout's own `.git` file
repointed at a sibling worktree's Git directory is accepted, as it was at the
base; macOS and Git 2.50.1 only; no Windows, separate-clone, or crash
durability testing. A pre-existing 300ms lock assertion in
`internal/update/update_test.go` can pass falsely on a loaded machine.

## Integration handoff

Main advanced from `2d6de36` to `d387853` with documentation-only commits
while this work ran, and `grove/brief.md` was edited on both sides
around its next-action section. Main was then merged into this branch and
that one conflict resolved by keeping both accounts: the repairs' state from
this branch and the G-023/G-025 direction from main. No code conflicted; the
merged tree builds, vets, passes `check` with 15 records, and passes the cli,
update, create, and repo packages. Main can now merge this branch without
conflict unless it advances again. After merging, rerun the full and race
suites on main; ancestry of this branch's tip, not these records' statuses,
establishes integration.
