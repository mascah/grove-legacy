## Outcome

Opening a card shows how that work item changed over time: when it was first
proposed, each commit that touched its record, and the status the record held
at that commit. The owner asked for this on 2026-09-19 after the first G-017
demo: the list of versions across branches did not say what had happened to an
item, and lineage was what they expected to find useful. Lineage is selected
direction; everything below is proposed design.

Git already holds the lineage, so nothing new is stored. For G-014 on
2026-09-19, `git log --follow` on its file plus the `status:` line at each
commit gave:

```text
e147e43 09-19 16:07  done      docs: close W-006 with evidence...
fd20223 09-19 14:48  proposed  docs: add reusable execution handoffs...
400e366 09-19 14:32  proposed  docs: review integrated CLI and shape...
```

Proposed: a History section in the card's detail pane for the focused version,
newest first, read from that version's branch or checkout HEAD. Read it when a
card is opened, not for every record during the board load, so the board's load
time (G-031) does not grow with history. Uncommitted live edits appear as a
first "uncommitted" row using the change classification the board already has.

## Constraints

Reads only, through Git, with the board's cancellation and one-read-at-a-time
rule. Commit subjects and author text are file-like input: escape them as the
board escapes record text. Follow renames of the record's file. History on one
branch says nothing about integration into another; do not imply it. No new
record fields and no stored history.

## Acceptance

1. A fixture record created, edited, renamed, and moved through statuses across
   commits shows each commit with its date, subject, and the status at that
   commit, newest first, for the branch of the focused version.
2. Two branches with different histories for one ID show different lineages
   depending on the focused version.
3. Control characters in a commit subject are displayed escaped.
4. Opening a card cancels cleanly and never blocks keys; the board load makes
   no history reads.
5. Targeted, full, and race suites, vet, and formatting pass; the owner judges
   the view in a demo.

## Evidence, 2026-09-20

Implemented on branch `worktree-W-012` from `a0fd23a` through
`/grove-work G-030`, following the [plan](G-033-card-lineage-plan.md).
On 2026-09-20 the owner selected "beside, history first": the card screen and
its version list stay, and History leads the details pane, following the
focused row (the board's checkout while the ID header has focus). That
placement is selected direction; the rest of the design remains the owner's to
judge in use. The [evidence](G-034-card-lineage-review.md)
maps each acceptance item to its tests and holds the suite results, the
independent review with dispositions, and the limits. What differs from the
proposal above:

- The read is `git log --follow --raw`, which names the record's blob at each
  commit, then one `cat-file --batch` for those blobs; no path is read back
  from Git.
- Merges are never rows, as in plain `git log --follow`: one that brought a
  branch's commits in would repeat them and name another branch, and asking
  Git to diff merges breaks rename following. Where the record's status is not
  the newest listed commit's, a first `here` row gives it and says why.
- A history read never makes a key wait: another version, refresh, a workspace
  selection, Esc, and quitting each cancel it.

Automated acceptance (items 1 to 4 and the suites of item 5) is met on the
branch.

## Owner acceptance, 2026-09-20

After running the demo the owner said it is "a step in the right direction",
that it "works as described", and that they now understand better what they
want next, which "doesn't block this work"; they will iterate later on the
information architecture of the TUI. That is acceptance of this outcome, the
other half of item 5, not of the card's layout as a final design.

## Next

Nothing under this record. Implementation is on branch `worktree-W-012`
(code `9337a44`), reviewed and accepted, and **not merged or pushed**: merging
it into main is the owner's step. The TUI's information architecture is later
work that the owner has not yet shaped.
