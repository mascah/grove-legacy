## Outcome

Grove and its test suite act only on the repository they are pointed at,
whatever Git environment they inherit. A Git hook, an editor, or a shell that
exports `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, or the other variables that name a
repository can no longer redirect a Git process Grove starts, and the tests
prove it. The owner asked for this on 2026-09-22 after the incident below and
called it a significant risk to the code.

## Constraints

**Observed on 2026-09-22:**

- A `git push` from the linked worktree `.claude/worktrees/G-081` ran
  lefthook's pre-push hook, `go test ./...`. Git exports
  `GIT_DIR=<repo>/.git/worktrees/G-081` to the hook (shown with a scratch
  `core.hooksPath` hook on `push --dry-run`), and every test fixture's
  `git init`, `commit`, `checkout`, and `worktree add` in a temp directory
  inherited it. The fixtures therefore acted on the real repository: the
  branch tip was replaced by a fixture commit and pushed to origin as PR #2's
  head, HEAD moved to a fixture branch, branches `bad-yaml`, `code`,
  `feature`, and `records` appeared, two temp worktrees were registered, and
  `core.bare = true` landed in the shared config, which made the main checkout
  refuse work-tree commands. The commits were intact and the owner repaired
  it by hand ([G-081](G-081-github-ci.md) has the commands).
- Product code spawned Git in three places, all `git -C dir …`, which
  `GIT_DIR` overrides just the same: `repo.GitContext`, the `cat-file --batch`
  reader in `internal/versions`, and `git grep` in `internal/create`. Nine
  test files spawned Git directly, and `internal/tui/testdata/terminal.py`
  spawns it from Python.

**Selected:** one guard at the root, `repo.Command`, that every Git process
goes through, rather than a per-call or hook-only fix; the hook keeps a
second, independent scrub. Variables dropped: `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`,
`GIT_INDEX_FILE`, `GIT_COMMON_DIR`, `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`,
`GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES`, `GIT_NAMESPACE`. Setting `GIT_DIR` to
point Grove at a repository other than its project path was never supported.

## Acceptance

1. No `exec.Command("git", …)` or `exec.CommandContext(…, "git", …)` remains
   outside `repo.Command` and its regression test; `grep` shows it.
2. A regression test in `internal/repo` sets `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_WORK_TREE`
   to a decoy repository and shows `repo.Command` acting on its own
   directory while an unguarded child lands in the decoy.
3. The whole suite, run with `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_WORK_TREE` exported to a
   decoy repository, passes and leaves the decoy's refs, branches, and
   worktrees unchanged.
4. lefthook's pre-push hook runs the suite with those variables unset.
5. `AGENTS.md` states the rule and names this record.

## Evidence

Implemented 2026-09-22 on `worktree-G-089` from `main` adce678, the same
day as the incident, at the owner's request, with no plan: the fix is one
function and its callers. Commits: 7924765 (the guard, every caller, the
regression test, the hook, the terminal script, `AGENTS.md`), 263a59a
(status), ca6a599 (review fixes), then the commit carrying this evidence and
[G-090](G-090-review-of-g-089-ambient-git-envi.md), which is the `candidate`.

**Against the acceptance:**

1. `grep -rn 'exec\.Command' --include='*.go'` finds Git spawned only in
   `repo.Command` and the regression test's deliberate unguarded control;
   the other hits run `go`, `python3`, and the test binary.
2. `TestCommandIgnoresAmbientRepository` in `internal/repo/command_test.go`
   points `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_WORK_TREE` at a decoy: `repo.Command` reports
   its own `.git`, the unguarded control reports the decoy's. The reviewer
   showed it fails with the `cmd.Env` line removed.
3. `GIT_DIR=<decoy>/.git GIT_WORK_TREE=<decoy> GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false go test
   -count=1 -timeout 120s ./...`: all packages ok; the decoy kept one commit,
   one branch, no worktrees, its refs hash unchanged; the worktree's status
   unchanged. Run by this session and again by the reviewer at ca6a599.
4. `lefthook.yml` pre-push runs `env -u` for all seven variables; the
   reviewer ran that line under lefthook 2.1.8 from a linked worktree and
   the child saw none of them while keeping `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE`.
5. `AGENTS.md` states the rule in the development-policy list and names
   this record.

**Decisions:** the seven variables are the ones that name a repository or
its parts; `GIT_COMMITTER_*`, `GIT_AUTHOR_*`, `GIT_TRACE`,
`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`, and `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` still reach the child because
tests and existing evidence rely on them. `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS`,
`GIT_PREFIX`, and `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` were tested and do not move
`git -C dir`. Pre-commit jobs are not scrubbed, with a comment saying why.
The history test's merge gained the committer identity it lacked, which
Linux CI in G-081 had exposed; that line conflicts textually with G-081's
own fix and is resolved by taking either.

**Verification** at ca6a599 on macOS, Go 1.26.5: `gofmt -l .` empty,
`go vet ./...`, `go run ./cmd/grove check` (`OK: 85 records`), plain
`go test -count=1 -timeout 120s ./...` all ok (`internal/versions` 7.3 s),
plus the decoy run above.

**Bounded adjustment after the merge with main:** PR #3's first CI run failed
`TestUpdateDetectsChangesDuringPreparation/target_replaced` on
`ubuntu-latest` only, twice. The publication guard in `internal/update`
compared file identity with `os.SameFile`; ext4 reuses a freed inode number
at once, so a record removed and recreated with the same bytes passed as the
same file, while APFS and the container's overlay filesystem hand out new
numbers. 07a63d3 also compares the modification time, which the product never
changes between the two reads. Outside this record's original outcome but
the same class as G-081's Linux fixes, and one line.

**Review:** G-090, two rounds, no blocking findings; the should-fix items
(hook variable list, `AGENTS.md` scope) and nits are fixed in ca6a599.

## Next

In Review. After PR #2 merged, `origin/main` was merged into this branch at
7fe4ccf, resolving the history test's merge line as planned, with the whole
verification rerun there; that merge commit is the candidate, and PR #3 runs
CI on it. Integrator, from the main checkout:

1. Merge PR #3 (or `git merge worktree-G-089`), then
   `go test -count=1 -timeout 120s ./...` on `main`; the hook is safe again
   from this merge on, so plain `git push` works.
2. Write the verdict here and `go run ./cmd/grove update G-089 --expect
   REVISION --set status=done`, committed on `main`.

verdict: LGTM
