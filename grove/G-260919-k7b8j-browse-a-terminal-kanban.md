## Outcome

See work in a terminal Kanban board, inspect differing committed/live versions
inside a card, and explicitly select an existing workspace without copying an
opaque selector. On 2026-09-19 the owner preferred the board over a standalone
version picker as the first terminal experience after reliability fixes.
The owner then selected bare `grove` as the TUI entrypoint, with the board as its
first screen; do not add a `grove board` subcommand. Board-first and this
entrypoint are selected direction. The layout, context policy and framework
below were proposed design; they are now implemented on branch
`worktree-W-009` as described, and remain the owner's to judge in use.
[Implementation plan](G-021-terminal-picker-plan.md);
[evidence](G-029-board-review.md).

## What the TUI means here

Calling `grove` with no arguments opens the persistent terminal application,
initially containing the Kanban board. In this checkout use `go run ./cmd/grove`.
Left/Right move between status columns; Up/Down move between cards. Enter opens a
card's versions and source details. Leaving restores the ordinary shell screen.
Grove still reads local files without a server, and the board stores no duplicate
state. The first workspace action resolves and returns a location; it does not
change the parent shell's directory or launch an editor.

Version selection serves a specific purpose inside a card: main may still say
proposed while Fable's checkout says done. Showing both lets the person inspect
the difference and choose the intended workspace. It is supporting navigation;
the board is the starting screen and everyday overview.

Proposed board (illustrative data, not current project status):

```text
Grove  /project    Board: live main    4 sources inspected
Proposed           Active             Done               Abandoned
> G-014            G-009              G-003
  Workspace safety Record updates     Inspect records
  4 versions       4 versions         4 versions
  G-015                               G-007
  Preserve updates                    Create records

Other sources: G-023 [2 versions]   (absent from this checkout)
Left/Right columns   Up/Down cards   Enter versions   b checkout   r refresh
```

The label identifies one live checkout as the board context, initially the
invocation's checkout. Only that context's live work status determines columns.
Its title labels its card. This is an explicitly scoped view, not an aggregate
status across branches. Opening the card shows all observed versions grouped by
ID, each with its own title, status and source. A committed `done` version on a
feature branch can coexist with main's `active` card. Nothing infers integration.

A separate Other sources shelf lists grouped work IDs absent from the selected
live checkout but present in another valid source. It has no lifecycle status;
Enter opens the same version view. This keeps newly created branch-only work
visible from main without assigning it a made-up main status. Questions and
decisions remain available through the CLI; they do not gain work-status columns.

## Command and interaction proposal

`grove` with no subcommand launches the TUI using existing project discovery
and Git scope. Optional `--project DIR` selects its initial project; `--json`
changes only the final workspace result, not the interactive display. Thus
`grove [--project DIR] [--json]` is the proposed full default-mode syntax.
Show all work groups; no positional work-ID shortcut or `board` subcommand.
Keep existing explicit subcommands noninteractive. `grove --help`, `grove -h`,
and `grove help` print usage and exit without project discovery or terminal setup.

- Left/Right (h/l) switch columns; Up/Down (j/k) move cards. At widths below
  100 columns show one status column at a time with all four status tabs and
  counts; below 40 columns or 10 rows show a resize message and retain quit.
  Tab switches focus between the status columns and Other sources shelf.
- Enter on any card opens its grouped versions; it never resolves directly from
  the board, even when one version exists. The version view initially highlights
  the ID header, not a default source. Up/Down moves across source rows; Enter on
  a concrete selectable version means Select workspace and calls fresh Resolve
  with exactly that selector. Identical bytes remain separate explicit choices.
- The version detail pane shows title/status, committed/live source, branch or
  detached HEAD, checkout when live, change classification, paths, revision,
  and scrollable source. Tab toggles row/detail focus; PageUp/PageDown scrolls.
  Narrow terminals show the focused pane. Esc returns from versions to the board.
- `b` opens a checkout chooser using live sources from the same inspection.
  Choosing a valid source rebuilds columns from its records; it does not switch
  any Git branch or shell directory. Invalid/absent sources show their reason
  and cannot become a healthy board context. If the invocation checkout is
  invalid, show that state explicitly and offer b; never call it an empty board.
- Successful workspace resolution exits, restores the terminal, prints the
  absolute project path plus newline on stdout (or workspace's existing JSON
  shape under `--json`), and prints escaped target/source context on stderr.
  The UI uses stderr; stdin and stderr must be terminals. Nonterminal use refuses
  before raw mode with exit 1, no stdout result, and guidance to explicit CLI
  subcommands (`list`, `versions`, `workspace`) or `--help`; it must not hang or
  silently switch to a different result format. Help needs no project/TTY.
  JSON is the lossless path interface for paths with control characters.
- A refused resolution stays in the version view with its reason and r refresh
  guidance. Missing checkout never creates one. Deleted rows remain visible but
  cannot be selected; invalid sources have diagnostics and no admitted versions.
- Incomplete results retain a persistent banner and a scrollable source/diagnostic
  view (`s`). Healthy explicit versions remain selectable. Total inventory failure
  offers retry/quit with no selectable rows, rather than a successful empty board.
- `r` refreshes explicitly. Disable workspace selection while a read is pending;
  clear version selection and return focus to its card/header. Keep board context
  only if its locator/path/attached identity still matches; otherwise require b
  to choose again. Ignore older asynchronous results. Do not poll, watch, cache
  persistently, filter/search, or add mouse interaction in this slice.
- q quits from anywhere; Esc on the board cancels, Esc on an overlay returns.
  Ordinary cancellation exits 0 without a workspace result; Ctrl-C exits 1.
  Terminal setup/output errors exit 1, malformed CLI usage 2. Cancel in-flight
  Git reads and restore terminal state; an old response cannot select a workspace
  after cancellation. No drag/drop or keyboard status mutation yet.

Escape terminal controls (including ESC and C1 characters) in all displayed
record/body/path text. Keep source line structure and original model bytes;
do not emit file-provided ANSI/OSC sequences, open URLs, or touch the clipboard.
Use display-cell-aware clipping for Unicode; meaning must remain clear without
color. Board columns and counts are derived, never written back to records.

## Technical recommendation and alternatives

Recommend Bubble Tea v2 for a small explicit state machine: UI events and read
results update state, and rendering derives from it. Its documented Model,
Update, View and command separation fits deterministic stale-result tests;
this is a design inference, not a Grove prototype result.
[Official documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/charm.land/bubbletea/v2).

Pin `charm.land/bubbletea/v2 v2.0.9` for the proposed implementation baseline;
its tagged module declares Go 1.25, below Grove's Go 1.26 floor.
[Release](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/releases/tag/v2.0.9),
[tagged module](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/blob/v2.0.9/go.mod).
Reuse its versioned `github.com/charmbracelet/x/term v0.2.2` for terminal checks
and `github.com/charmbracelet/x/ansi v0.11.7` for display width/clipping when
needed, promoting direct imports explicitly. No Bubbles/Lip Gloss dependency
is necessary for the first board and version inspector. Dependency compatibility has been
inspected in documentation, not built in this review.

`tview` is the credible alternative: it supplies tree, table and text widgets,
which could shorten screen assembly. Its widget-first API is less aligned with
the explicitly testable selection/read-result state chosen here; that is an
engineering preference, not a measured performance claim.
[Official tview documentation](https://github.com/rivo/tview).
Avoid a custom raw-terminal framework; it would add lifecycle/input work to the
slice. No benchmark or hands-on framework comparison was conducted.

Keep UI code in `internal/tui`; call existing version contracts in process.
Add context-aware read wrappers to versions/repo while retaining existing
non-context entrypoints for the CLI. Propagate cancellation to all Git commands,
including cat-file, and check it between filesystem/source reads. Allow only one
read operation in flight. Bubble Tea commands do not themselves cancel arbitrary
work, so the UI must own and cancel the read context explicitly.
[Runtime source](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/blob/v2.0.9/tea.go).

## Constraints

G-014/G-015/G-016 repairs are prerequisites under the selected after-fixes
sequence; verify their integration, not only done statuses. G-002 stays accepted.
No record or configuration changes, index/ref changes, worktree provisioning,
claims, agent launches, child shell/editor, body editing, or new record schema.
Terminal mode/output is the only intended interactive side effect. Do not create
debug/panic log files in the repository; strip the framework's debug-log switch
from the UI environment and do not enable file logging. Keep existing explicit
subcommand output and ordinary local-file use intact. The deliberate CLI behavior
change is that an absent subcommand requests the TUI rather than returning the
current command-required usage error.

## Acceptance

1. Main/feature fixtures with differing work statuses and titles produce columns
   from exactly the chosen live source. b switches displayed context without Git
   writes. One work card exists per ID in that context; branch-only work remains
   discoverable in the unplaced Other sources shelf. Questions/decisions are not
   coerced into work columns. Invalid context is distinct from an empty board.
2. Card Enter opens grouped versions without resolving. A version Enter passes
   exactly its displayed selector to Resolve; no source is selected automatically.
   Identical bytes remain separate choices, and each version shows its own status.
   Deleted/invalid observations cannot resolve; G-002 stays intact.
3. Fresh resolution exits with workspace's output contract; stale/moved/foreign/
   disappearing/ambiguous/missing targets keep the version view with a reason.
   Incomplete warnings stay visible and attributable. Refresh clears old selection
   and never routes by a previously occupied row position.
4. Board/overlay navigation, responsive columns, scrolling, refresh, context
   changes, and cancellation have deterministic model tests, including late read
   replies and no second read while one is pending. Escape OSC/ANSI/C1 controls;
   test wide Unicode, narrow terminals and large bodies without changing bytes.
5. A pseudo-terminal fixture proves terminal restoration, separate UI/result
   streams, no-output cancellation and cancellation of a blocked Git read. An
   actual board → card → version → resolve → show workflow reads exactly the
   selected bytes. Hash Git/configuration/records across success and refusal.
6. Targeted/full/race suites, vet, formatting, Grove check, dependency review,
   and independent behavior review pass. Owner usability feedback on a real
   Kanban demo remains separate evidence from automated tests or screenshots.
7. Bare `grove` launches the TUI in a terminal, initially showing the board.
   Optional project/JSON flags obey the default-mode contract; help works outside
   a project without a TTY. Nonterminal default use refuses promptly and existing
   explicit subcommands retain their contracts. No `board` subcommand is added.

## Evidence, 2026-09-19

Implemented on branch `worktree-W-009` from `acfc905`, after the G-014 to G-016
repairs were confirmed in main by Git ancestry. Final code revision `184b8c3`.
The [evidence](G-029-board-review.md) maps each
acceptance item to its tests, and holds the suite results, both independent
reviews with dispositions, and the remaining limits; the
[plan](G-021-terminal-picker-plan.md#adjustments-made-while-implementing-2026-09-19)
records what changed from this proposal and why. The changes that matter to
this record's text:

- The framework reads its debug-log switches from the process environment, so
  the board unsets `TEA_DEBUG`, `TEA_TRACE`, and `UV_DEBUG` rather than
  passing a filtered environment.
- The framework ignores screen write errors; the board ends the session with
  exit 1 at the first one instead of staying open unseen.
- The board starts on the live source whose Git directory is the invocation's
  own, which holds through symlinked paths, `--project`, and nested prefixes.
- A hangup cancels the session like an interrupt.

Automated acceptance (items 1 to 5, 7, and the suites, dependency check, and
independent review of item 6) is met on the branch. **Owner usability feedback
on a real demo, the other half of item 6, has not happened**, so this record
stays active. No screenshot or test stands in for it.

## Owner feedback, 2026-09-19 (first impressions of the demo)

Observed by the owner, in their terms:

1. The board is an acceptable basic starting point; clearer boundaries and
   colour can come later.
2. The version view did not help. A done item showed six to eight rows, all
   `done`, the live ones all `unchanged`, every detail pane the same content
   with only header fields differing. The owner could not tell what a version
   is or what to do from there, and asked for a refresher on "workspace". What
   they expected to be useful instead is a work item's lineage over time: when
   it was proposed, the commits that touched it, and its status at each.
3. Concern that a full load takes about 0.6 s at this small scale.
4. What `b` (checkout) does to the board is confusing.
5. "Source" is unclear.

Measured afterwards, not owner judgment: the 0.6 s is real (0.56 to 0.57 s for
`versions` from a built binary; `list` of one checkout is under 10 ms). One
load spawns 44 Git processes, 35 of them single-path `rev-parse` calls made per
worktree for the G-014/G-016 provenance checks. The cost grows with worktrees
and branches, not with records. In this repository every version of G-003 has
the same content revision, so its eight rows are one content seen from four
branch tips and four checkouts.

The owner selected the first two adjustments the same day; both are implemented
on this branch in `959def6`:

- A card's list has one row per distinct content. Where several places hold
  the same bytes the row is a fold ("▸ done  same on 4 branches, 4 checkouts")
  whose details show the content once and name every place. A fold selects
  nothing: Enter lists its places, and each remains a separate explicit choice
  that Enter resolves, so acceptance item 2 and G-002 hold. A board card notes
  "N versions" only when versions differ. G-003 here went from eight rows to one.
- The interface says "branch" and "checkout" for what the code and the
  `versions` command call committed and live sources. The Other sources shelf
  is now "Elsewhere". `b` reads "view another checkout", and its screen says
  that only the display changes. The card's header pane explains what a version
  is. The `versions` and `workspace` commands keep their words and their
  selector contract; only the board changed.

Lineage is [G-030](G-030-card-lineage.md). Load time is
[G-031](G-031-load-scaling.md), measured and fixed on this branch.

## Owner acceptance, 2026-09-19

After the folded card, the wording, and the G-031 load fix, the owner said the
board "seems good enough for the moment" and asked to close this out and merge
it. That is acceptance of a starting point, not of the design: clearer
boundaries and colour (feedback item 1), lineage (G-030), and whether a load
should read every branch (G-031) remain open. The other half of acceptance
item 6 is met.

## Next

Nothing under this record. Integrated into main by merge on 2026-09-19.
Continue with [G-030](G-030-card-lineage.md). Worktree creation, record edits
from the board, and agent execution remain separate later work; G-023 does not
depend on this.
