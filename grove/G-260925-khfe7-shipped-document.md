## Meaning

A document the `grove` binary carries and prints or writes wherever it runs:
the work, shaping and review guides (`grove guide work|shape|review`) and
the record model (`grove guide model`). It is read in projects that hold none of Grove's files and
whose own `G-` IDs are live, so it must read the same, and be true, in every
one of them: it links only within itself or to `https://`, names another
shipped document by the command that prints it, and names no Grove record,
path, invocation or history. This repository's file is the one editable
owner; the binary's copy is what an adopting project reads, and `grove
version` names that copy: its guides digest covers the three guides and the
model, and its content digest covers every shipped document together with
the adapters `init` generates ([G-170](G-170-release-identity.md)).

Not shipped: the brief, the command reference, the board guide, AGENTS.md,
this repository's records, and its own `.claude/skills/`,
`.agents/skills/` and `.claude/agents/` adapters, which read the documents
as files. The adapters `init` writes, the `grove-reviewer` agent definition
among them, are generated text under the same rule, not documents: they
load a shipped guide by command with their entrypoint revision
([G-169](G-169-harness-upgrade-compatibility.md)).

## Relationships

The rule lives in AGENTS.md's constraints; its reason is
[G-146](G-146-how-should-an-adopting-project-r.md)'s answer, which
[G-151](G-151-strip-grove-repository-pointers.md) extends from links to
mentions. `TestGuideAndVersionNeedNoProject` enforces it. Delivered
by [G-040](G-040-portable-bootstrap.md) (the guides, `init`),
[G-134](G-134-bound-an-attempt-at-its-plan-and.md) (the reviewer definition,
whose body [G-169](G-169-harness-upgrade-compatibility.md) moved into the
review guide)
and [G-144](G-144-give-adopting-projects-the-recor.md) (the model).
