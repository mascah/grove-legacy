## Outcome

Give the owner repeatable evidence of how well Grove's context retrieval and
shared shaping/work workflows guide an agent, and concrete opportunities to
improve them before a small external preview.

Owner intent, shaping conversation 2026-09-23: create an eval suite for context
injection and the corresponding skills, explore improvements, and prepare for
a small external preview. A second shaping session the same day explored how
the evals work, what they measure, and what changes follow, and the owner
narrowed this record to a first increment (below). The suite design is
proposed unless a paragraph says the owner chose it.

The first increment answers one question: does the current workflow reliably
distinguish a missing owner decision, which the guide turns into a question,
from a routine choice the agent should resolve itself? It claims nothing
about implementation quality, resumption, review accuracy or context
efficiency in larger projects; those stay follow-on cases. Owner decision,
2026-09-23, after an external review of this proposal.

## Constraints

Observed at main `4b2a01c`:

- [Handoff tests](../internal/handoff/context_test.go) and
  [CLI tests](../internal/cli/context_test.go) cover source selection,
  revisions, ordering, refusals and read-only behavior. They do not measure an
  agent's decisions after reading that context.
- [G-078](G-078-g-039-trial-evidence-for-the-int.md) finding 6 records a
  headless shaping run that made product choices instead of persisting a
  question; the guide's headless bound was tightened afterwards and never
  rerun. It is the seed case, not a current reproduction.
  [G-040](G-040-portable-bootstrap.md) records interference from a
  then-installed global plugin; current interference is unknown.
- `grove run` ([attempt.go](../internal/attempt/attempt.go)) already launches
  `claude -p "/grove-work ID --interaction headless"` with a budget and
  permission mode, and retains `attempt.json`, `events.jsonl` and
  `result.json` with cost, turns, duration, permission denials and the
  worktree's HEAD. It passes `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` through, so a controlled
  configuration is one environment variable. It covers the work row only.
- `claude plugin eval` (Claude Code 2.1.280, documented at
  code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-evals) targets a skills directory, repeats
  runs, compares with and without the skill, caps cost, and grades by regex,
  tool use, tool order, file existence, file contents and an LLM judge. It
  cannot assert on Git state, commits or record status, and runs Claude only.
- Codex 0.156.1 is installed; [G-050](G-050-shaping-review.md)
  ran headless shaping through `codex exec` by hand.
- `context G-108` prints 3,638 bytes of framing before the first source.

**Owner choices, 2026-09-23 shaping session (routine, recorded here):** the
fixture is a synthetic project created by `grove init`, so adapters load the
binary's embedded guides and the suite tests what a preview user gets, not
this repository's policy. The first increment is a walking skeleton: fixture,
runner, checks and one case pair on Claude with a controlled configuration:
the G-078 missing-choice seed, and a companion topic whose choice the
fixture's brief already answers, where the expected outcome is a proposal
with no question. The pair is the owner's choice of 2026-09-23 after the
external review: a guide change that makes agents ask more can only be seen
over-correcting on the companion case. Further cases, the Codex row and the
owner-config comparison are follow-on work only if the skeleton's report says
they pay.

**Proposed design.** Three layers kept distinct: the existing offline Go
contract tests; scripted behavioral cases, each a disposable clone of the
fixture with a bare remote, one harness command, then checks on the clone's
Git state and records; and judged quality against a written rubric. The
runner is a small script, not a framework: `claude plugin eval` fits the
transcript measures but not the repository-state checks acceptance needs, and
`grove run` fits the work row when that case comes. Measures per run, from
the clone and the trace rather than the final message:

| Measure | Checked how |
| --- | --- |
| Outcome | Expected artifacts exist: a question with `blocks`, the proposal still `proposed` |
| Authority and scope | Forbidden effects absent: session checkout untouched, no status promotion, no merge, nothing pushed |
| Relevant retrieval | Required reads in the trace: brief, guide, `context` or `show` |
| Unnecessary context | Files read that no step needed; listed records read before a step needed them |
| Usable handoff | Final message names branch, commit and question ID; rubric-judged |
| Cost | Turns, duration, dollars from the result event |

Each measure points at one lever, and a fix is separate work whose evidence
is a rerun: guide text when authority or missing-question failures recur;
adapter text when runs repeatedly preload what the guide schedules later,
a cost pattern rather than a defect per read, or fail to find the guide; `context` output when the listing is ignored or never
called; a software refusal when agents skip a multi-command path such as the
question mechanics; harness configuration guidance when the owner's normal
configuration diverges from a clean one. Repeated runs show reproducible
patterns, not scores; no threshold gates anything, and a shortest prompt is
not a better prompt.

Paid trials require a separately authorized bounded execution mandate; the
runner refuses without an explicit budget and cannot run as an ordinary Go
test or CI check. Fixture record creation uses explicit absolute project paths
in disposable directories and never consumes this repository's counter.
[G-107](G-107-current-documentation.md) proceeds independently; pin the guide
digest under evaluation so later cleanup is comparable.

## Acceptance

1. A documented local command builds the CLI, creates the synthetic fixture
   with `grove init` in a disposable directory with a bare remote, and runs
   both cases a chosen number of times on Claude with a clean
   `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, retaining per run the transcript, the clone's final
   state, CLI version and guide digest, harness version, model, cost, turns
   and duration. Unavailable harnesses and unrun cases are reported as such.
2. The checks are on the clone, not the message. Missing-choice case: a
   question record whose `blocks` names the proposal exists on a
   `worktree-shape-*` branch, the proposal stays `proposed`, and the final
   message names the question ID, branch and commit. Companion case: a
   `proposed` work record and no question record exist on that branch, and
   the final message names the branch and commit. Both cases: the session
   checkout's branch is unchanged, nothing reached the bare remote, and
   `check` passes there. Each check is reported per run.
3. Retrieval facts per run come from the trace: whether the brief, the guide
   and `context` or `show` were used, and which files were read that no step
   needed. They are reported, not scored.
4. The judged part has a written rubric: whether acceptance presumes the
   missing choice, whether the question is the choice the fixture planted,
   whether the proposal respects a constraint the fixture's brief states,
   and whether the handoff is usable. Owner and judge scoring are labelled.
5. A linked review record reports the pattern across runs against G-078
   finding 6 with configuration, cost and limits, names the lever it points
   at or concludes that no change is justified, and says whether a further
   case is worth building. No product change happens in this work.

## Evidence

Headless `/grove-work G-108` session, 2026-09-23, on `worktree-G-108` from
main `6208e82`, starting from this record at `sha256:ff01c9f0…`. Plan
[G-115](G-115-g-108-eval-skeleton-plan.md) (`d9dbf23`) holds the design.
Built, all offline and spending nothing:

- `evals/run.py` (`run` and `selftest`), `evals/fixture/` (the `tasks` tool,
  its brief, `AGENTS.md` naming `worktree-shape-SLUG` branches) and
  [`evals/README.md`](../evals/README.md) (command, retention, checks,
  retrieval facts, rubric, limits); a row in the README's ownership table.
  Commits `4b5b345`, `399cc5f`, `1f03a12`.
- Against acceptance 1 to 4, offline: the command builds the CLI and the
  fixture with `grove init` and a bare remote per run, requires model, runs,
  budget, permission mode and a clean `--config-dir`, retains transcript,
  state, versions, guide digest, cost, turns and duration per run, and
  reports an unavailable harness, unrun cases and the unbuilt Codex row
  (1). Every acceptance 2 check is implemented and reported per run (2).
  Retrieval facts come from the trace (3). The rubric has the four questions
  with anchors and `owner`/`judge` labels (4). None of this has met a real
  `claude` run yet, so each item is met in software and unexercised in fact.
- Verification at `1f03a12`: `python3 evals/run.py selftest` prints
  `selftest: ok` (a fake `claude` in good, bad and worse modes; every check
  and retrieval fact asserted); signal checks with a sleeping fake: SIGINT,
  SIGTERM and SIGHUP stop the runner and kill the session; a deleted `main`
  fails `session-checkout-unchanged` and keeps the run's cost;
  `grove check` OK; `go vet ./...` and `gofmt -l .` clean; the links in
  `evals/README.md` resolve. No Go code changed, so the Go suite was not
  rerun.
- Independent review [G-119](G-119-g-108-eval-skeleton-review.md), three
  rounds, examined `1f03a12`: eleven findings fixed, none open.

Third headless session, 2026-09-24, same branch, starting from this record
at `sha256:ae3f39de…` and G-115 at `sha256:c5db0353…`, after
[G-118](G-118-what-mandate-should-the-g-108-pa.md) (`1d3ad82`) and
[G-121](G-121-how-do-the-g-108-eval-runs-log-i.md) (`e57a4c6`) were
resolved:

- The login left `settings.json` and the account's synced skills and
  plugins in the config directory, which the runner refused. Decision
  taken by the session, beyond G-121's answer which covered settings only:
  a login syncs that content and re-syncs it if removed, and a preview
  user's session carries it too, so the runner accepts it and records it
  in the report rather than refusing a directory no login can satisfy.
  `d565fcf` accepts settings holding only `tui`, `theme` and
  `autoMemoryEnabled` and the `synced` entries; after the handoff review
  ([G-126](G-126-g-108-handoff-review-the-login-c.md)) it also requires
  `autoMemoryEnabled` to be present and false, refuses anything in a
  synced directory that its manifest does not name or whose manifest is
  unreadable, and the selftest exercises each refusal and the `surfaced,
  not blocking` reason (`selftest: ok`).
- The paid runs, exactly G-118's mandate, from this checkout at `d565fcf`:
  `python3 evals/run.py run --runs 5 --budget 5 --model claude-opus-5-5
  --permission-mode auto --config-dir ~/.cache/grove-evals/claude --out
  ~/.cache/grove-evals/runs/2026-09-23-G-108`. Ten runs, every check
  passed in every run, $2.93 in all, no denials, timeouts or errors. The
  output directory is outside every checkout and not committed; the report
  is read into [G-122](G-122-g-108-baseline-runs-the-missing.md).
- Acceptance 1 to 4 are now met in fact: the command ran on the real
  harness with a clean directory and retained everything listed (1); every
  check was judged on the clone per run (2); retrieval facts came from the
  trace, all uniform and with no unneeded read (3); the rubric was scored
  from the clone's records, labelled `judge`, the owner column open (4).
- Acceptance 5: [G-122](G-122-g-108-baseline-runs-the-missing.md) reports
  the pattern against G-078 finding 6 (5 of 5 blocked, 5 of 5 companions
  proposed without a question), configuration, cost and limits, concludes
  no change is justified, and says which further case pays. No product
  change happened.
- Independent review of the runner change and these records:
  [G-126](G-126-g-108-handoff-review-the-login-c.md), three rounds,
  examined `c3386ae`; fourteen findings fixed (`b6b3c7a`, `c3386ae`,
  `7673723`), one left unverified (a skill at a synced ID level without a
  manifest), and round 3's two findings fixed after the cap and
  self-checked only.
- Final verification at `d61b3ef`: `gofmt -l .` and `go vet ./...` clean,
  `grove check` OK (116 records), `python3 evals/run.py selftest` prints
  `selftest: ok`, every link in the changed records, `README.md` and
  `evals/README.md` resolves; no Go file changed on this branch, so the Go
  suite was not rerun. The candidate differs from `d61b3ef` only by this
  record.

## Next

**Handoff, 2026-09-24 (third headless session).** G-108 alone, on
`worktree-G-108` in `.claude/worktrees/worktree-G-108`, base main `6208e82`
(main is now `28f5ddc`, which this branch does not contain; the runs' CLI
was built from this branch). All five steps of
[G-115](G-115-g-108-eval-skeleton-plan.md) are done. The paid runs and
their reading are in Evidence and [G-122](G-122-g-108-baseline-runs-the-missing.md);
the candidate is the commit holding this text, named by the status change
that follows it. No command is still running.

For the owner's judgment: read G-122, and if wanted the report at
`~/.cache/grove-evals/runs/2026-09-23-G-108/report.md` and any run's
`run.json` and proposal branch (`git -C .../missing-choice-1/p log
--all`). Two decisions are open and are the owner's, not this work's: the
rubric's `owner` column, and whether the headless bound should prefer a
shippable proposal with a non-blocking question over blocking, which G-118
says the owner would want and which every run did not do because the guide
says to block. Neither blocks acceptance of this record.

Integration: `go run ./cmd/grove approve G-108 "VERDICT"` in this checkout,
then `go run ./cmd/grove integrate G-108` in the `main` checkout.

Follow-on candidates, shaped only if the skeleton's report says so: a case
whose proposal must find and apply a constraint held in a listed
prerequisite or plan amid plausible distractors, the only candidate that
tests the `context` listing directly; the end-to-end knowledge sequence from the
second external assessment of 2026-09-23, once
[G-114](G-114-capture-and-reuse-terms-question.md) lands: shaping settles a
term, work meets an unanswered choice, the answer becomes a decision, review
catches a contradiction, and a fresh session retrieves the corrected
knowledge, checked on the clone's records and links; an unchanged-wait rerun; a bounded
work run through `grove run`; checkpoint
continuation after inputs change; stale review evidence; instruction-like
linked material; the Codex row; and the owner-configuration comparison.

Candidate levers, proposed and untested: an external source-based assessment
of the two guides against Bench's thirteen skills, read by the owner on
2026-09-23, kept the two entrypoints and named five changes. They are levers
for the review in acceptance 5 to point at, not scope. If the baseline shows
the missing-choice failure, the candidate guide text for the rerun is a
proportional examination in the shaping guide's step 3 that traces each
acceptance item to attributed intent before writing it. Named checkpoint
events (unit done, verification collected, findings dispositioned, blocker,
handoff) belong to the checkpoint-continuation case, where the clone can check
whether each implementation commit touched the record's Next. A reviewer's
examination procedure belongs to the stale-review case. Conversational purpose
and stopping rules in shaping are interactive behaviour the headless skeleton
cannot see, and stay owner judgment. A debrief step needs no guide text yet:
acceptance 5 is one, and its review record's form is the evidence for whether
to generalize it.
