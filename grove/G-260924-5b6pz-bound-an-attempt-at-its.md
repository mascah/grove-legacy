## Outcome

The owner can launch an attempt that prepares and stops at a committed plan,
read that plan, and relaunch implementation from it as a fresh attempt with
its own model and effort; every independent review runs on a Grove-owned
reviewer definition with one standard brief; and each attempt records the
model, effort and reviewer definition it actually used.

Owner intent, shaping conversation 2026-09-24: the owner wants the handoff
points inside execution handled more distinctly, with a human look at the
plan before implementation when they want one, as superpowers gates spec and
plan; and wants to be able to consider different models per phase, with
pre-defined agent definitions carrying tailored instructions, as bench's
roles did. The owner asked to understand what that takes before committing
to it, read the attempt analysis below, and agreed to this scope: the
per-launch bound and the per-phase model and reviewer, with role profiles and
a second harness left until [G-135](G-135-run-the-g-108-eval-pair-on-codex.md)
reports. The routine choices below (flag spelling, the reviewer definition's
delivery, the experiment's proposed models and effort) were made in that
session with the owner present. The owner also expects, 2026-09-24, that preparation and review
should run at a higher reasoning effort than implementation, and chose the
experiment's levels (acceptance 5); that is the routing the experiment
tests, not a default this record sets. The flag
spelling, the reviewer definition's delivery and the experiment's target are
proposed design where labelled.

## Constraints

Observed at main `282d282`, from the sixteen Grove-owned attempts under
`.git/grove/attempts/` (event logs and results read in full) and the code:

- **Phase order is uniform and no human reads the plan before code.** Every
  implementing attempt ran context, code reading, a plan in one to three
  minutes, `status=active`, implementation, one fresh reviewer subagent, one
  to three fix rounds by messaging that reviewer, then the review record,
  evidence and `status=review`. Four attempts wrote a plan record (G-103,
  G-115, G-116, G-131) and implemented against it within minutes. The plan
  is read by a person only when a question stops the attempt.
- **The mid-run gate exists and works.** Three attempts stopped on a
  question written during preparation: `G-109.20260923T194926Z` (G-117, a
  plan and a question in 4.4 minutes for $1.62, record left `proposed`),
  `G-108.20260923T194708Z` (G-118) and `G-108.20260924T004935Z` (G-121).
  The owner answered in 17 minutes, 5 hours and 7 minutes; each resumed
  attempt reused the worktree and implemented. Re-entry cost 2 to 4
  minutes and $1 to $2.50 per resumed attempt.
- **The phase after the reviewer is the longest and runs at the highest
  context.** Fix rounds, the review record, evidence and the handoff took
  24 minutes on G-046 (278k to 352k tokens of context), 18 on G-108's first
  attempt, 14 on G-109's second (210k to 254k) and 10 on G-125 (208k to
  249k). No attempt checkpointed between `active` and the handoff.
- **Outcomes.** All ten items reached done; nine were accepted on the first
  candidate; the two feedback rounds were about intent (G-107 "missed the
  intent", G-129 "poke"), which no code reviewer catches and which a plan
  read before implementation is the earliest point that could have caught,
  once in ten. Total spend about $84.
- **Every review ran on an unrecorded, user-level definition.** Each attempt
  dispatched the `reviewer` subagent from `~/.claude/agents/reviewer.md`,
  the owner's startup-team persona with `model: opus`, outside this
  repository and unversioned; the attempt facts record only that an agent
  by that name existed (the init event). Its team instructions did not
  appear in any of 28 reviewer messages checked; the brief each attempt
  wrote dominated, and those sixteen briefs differ in what the reviewer may
  run and whether it gets a commit, a range or a branch. A preview user has
  no such agent. `G-108.20260924T010336Z`, the one attempt whose main model
  differed, shows the split: $7.78 on Fable for the session, $1.61 on Opus
  for the reviewer, from the result event's per-model usage.
- **Runner and harness.** [attempt.go](../internal/attempt/attempt.go)
  composes `claude -p "/grove-work ID --interaction headless"` with budget,
  permission mode, session and an optional `--model`, records the requested
  model in `attempt.json` and the actual one from the init event; there is
  no `--effort`. Claude Code 2.1.281 accepts `--effort`, `--agents
  <json-or-file>` in print mode, and project agents in `.claude/agents/`.
  The adapters ([Claude](../.claude/skills/grove-work/SKILL.md),
  `.agents/skills/grove-work/`) report any argument other than IDs and
  `--interaction MODE` as an error. The board's attempt outcomes are
  "candidate ready", "waiting on question" and "question answered: R
  again", grouped Needs you, Running, Settled
  ([attempts.go](../internal/tui/attempts.go), G-109, G-125).
- **Guide and terms.** The [work guide](../docs/work-execution.md) step 4
  ends at a committed plan and step 5 sets `active` when implementation
  starts; its Lifecycle paragraph says preparation is a fact inside
  `active`, while G-109's first attempt left the record `proposed` with a
  plan, which is the behaviour this record keeps. [G-055](G-055-preparation.md)
  says a technical plan does not wait for a human sign-off unless it needs
  a product choice; a caller bounding an attempt at the plan is the
  mandate's end, not a gate the plan needs, and G-055 may need that
  sentence. The brief selects "no universal plan gate" (kept: the bound is
  per launch) and "route model strength by uncertainty and consequence and
  retain actual configuration per attempt" (this record implements the
  retention and the per-phase choice). [G-101](G-101-attempt-mechanism.md)
  pins attempts to a Claude process; unchanged here.
- **What transfers from elsewhere.** Superpowers (plugin cache 6.4.1)
  front-loads human gates at spec, plan and execution method, then executes
  without asking; its execution guidance says a fully specified plan runs
  well on a mid-tier model and the strongest model earns its cost at the
  final review. Bench (`../bench/meta/team/*.md`) separated a role's
  mandate (`writes: false` for review) from the adapter naming a provider,
  with `model: strong|fast` in the role. The separation transfers; the
  catalogs do not. The owner's own `eng` on Sonnet and `pm` and `reviewer`
  on Opus already encode that routing.
- **The coupling.** Routing implementation to a faster model pays only if
  preparation writes a plan an implementer with less judgment can execute.
  Today's plans are written for the session that implements them. The
  experiment below is the test, and it is the reason the model choice and
  the plan bound are one record.

In scope, proposed design:

1. **A per-launch bound at the plan.** `/grove-work G-030 --until plan`,
   `$grove-work G-030 --until plan` and `grove run G-030 --until plan`,
   with the board's `R` asking. The spelling is chosen: it names the
   artifact the bound ends at and leaves room for a later bound at another
   step. The work guide's step 4
   says once: under that bound, commit the plan and any question,
   checkpoint the runnable continuation in the record's Next naming the
   plan's revision, leave the status as found, and return. The adapters
   accept the argument. The runner carries it in the prompt and in
   `attempt.json`. A rerun with nothing changed returns the same checkpoint
   under the guide's unchanged-wait rule. The relaunch (`R`, or `grove run`
   without the bound) is the owner's approval of the plan, attributable
   through the plan revision the next attempt reads: no plan status, field
   or approval record.
2. **A plan-ready outcome on the board**, beside the existing ones, under
   Needs you, with the continuation as its next action.
3. **Per-phase model and effort.** `grove run` gains `--effort`, passed
   through and recorded with the requested model, so a bounded preparation
   attempt and the implementation attempt that follows it can differ in
   both; the attempt facts add the per-model cost the result event carries,
   so the two attempts show their split.
4. **A Grove-owned reviewer.** A `grove-reviewer` agent definition carried
   in the binary like the guides and written by `init` beside the skills
   (`.claude/agents/grove-reviewer.md`, managed marker, created, kept or
   updated as the skills are). Written by `init` rather than passed with
   `--agents`, because `--agents` reaches only sessions the runner launches,
   while an interactive `/grove-work` session reviews through the same
   definition only if the checkout holds it. Its body is the standard brief: read-only; what it
   receives (checkout, exact range or commit, the record's acceptance and
   constraints, what it may run); what it checks, including the knowledge
   check G-114 added; what it returns (findings with evidence, dispositions
   after fixes, limits). `model: inherit` by default, with its reasoning effort set in
   the definition's frontmatter, where Claude Code reads an agent's model
   and effort, `high` as the owner chose, so the review's effort is
   independent of the implementing session's. Step 6 names it and says what the session
   passes it. The attempt facts record the
   definition's digest or its absence. The distinct name leaves the owner's
   `reviewer` untouched. Codex has no agent-definition equivalent found in
   `codex exec --help`; step 6's "if the harness cannot supply an
   independent reviewer, say so" stands and the Codex adapter is unchanged.
5. **One routing experiment on real work** (acceptance 5).
6. Reconcile [docs/commands.md](../docs/commands.md) (run flags, attempt
   facts, init output) and [docs/board.md](../docs/board.md), and add one
   sentence to [G-055](G-055-preparation.md): a caller may bound an attempt
   at its plan, and that is the mandate's end, not a gate the plan needs.
   The owner chose to change the settled term on 2026-09-24.

Out of scope: role profiles or model defaults in `grove.yaml` (budget and
permission mode stay required per launch, as G-045 chose); a second harness
in the runner (G-101; G-135's report decides whether to shape it); per-task
implementer subagents by default (a plan may call for them); splitting the
guide into phase files (the fixed reading is about 35k tokens against peaks
of 65k to 352k, and every phase needs the authority and staging rules); a
universal plan gate; and bounds at other steps.

## Acceptance

1. The work guide states the bound once, in step 4, and step 6 names the
   reviewer definition and what the session passes it; both adapters accept
   `--until plan` and still reject other text; `grove guide work` prints
   the change; the Evidence records the new guides digest against
   `3c9996e33e42`.
2. `grove run ID --until plan --model M --effort E`, and `R` on the board,
   start an attempt whose command carries the bound, the model and the
   effort; `attempt.json`, `grove attempt` and the attempt screen show the
   three, the init's actual model, and the result's per-model cost; `run`
   without them behaves as before.
3. With the runner's fake provider and in one disposable clone with the real
   one: a bounded attempt ends with a committed current plan record whose
   `work` names the ID, the work record unchanged in status with a
   checkpoint naming the plan revision and the continuation, and no change
   outside records; the board lists it under Needs you with the plan-ready
   outcome; `R` there launches the implementation attempt on the reused
   worktree; a second bounded run with nothing changed returns the same
   checkpoint.
4. `init` writes `.claude/agents/grove-reviewer.md` with the managed marker,
   reports it as `created`, `kept`, `unchanged` or `updated` like the skills,
   and the existing init tests cover it; an attempt's facts show the
   definition's digest, or that none was present.
5. The routing experiment, on the first real assignment after this lands
   whose plan is more than a "no plan needed" note, under a budget the
   owner confirms at assignment (proposed cap $30 for the two attempts,
   against the sixteen-attempt mean of about $5 per attempt): a bounded
   attempt on Claude Opus 5.5 at `xhigh` effort, then an implementation
   attempt on Opus 5.5 at `medium`, reviewed through `grove-reviewer` on
   Opus 5.5 at `high`. The owner chose these on 2026-09-24: one model
   throughout, so the experiment measures effort alone, with the plan
   sufficiency question then bearing on effort rather than on model
   strength. The assignment's record reports, in Evidence, each
   attempt's model, effort, cost and duration, the review's
   findings and rounds, whether the plan sufficed for the implementer or
   what it lacked, and the owner's verdict, read against the sixteen-attempt
   figures above. The experiment's result changes nothing inside this work.
6. `grove check` passes; `gofmt`, `go vet`, the full uncached suite and the
   pseudo-terminal script pass; documentation links resolve.

## Evidence

Headless attempt `G-134.20260924T220310Z`, branch `worktree-G-134` in
`.claude/worktrees/worktree-G-134`, base `98ce628` (main), started from this
record at `sha256:f56ade5e…` and wrote plan
[G-136](G-136-g-134-plan-plan-bound-per-phase.md) (`c197477`) before
implementing. Implementation `a84d01d`, `f712cfb`, `ccbb73c`; the candidate
is the commit that records this evidence, named in `candidate`.

Decisions taken, each routine within the proposed design:

- The reviewer definition's one owner is this repository's
  [`.claude/agents/grove-reviewer.md`](../.claude/agents/grove-reviewer.md),
  embedded by `guides.go` (a named dot-path embeds) and written verbatim by
  `init` as a managed file, so `init` here reports it `unchanged`.
  Frontmatter: `model: inherit`, `effort: high`, `disallowedTools: Edit,
  Write, NotebookEdit`.
- `--effort` is one token passed through: the provider owns the values and
  refuses others. `--until` accepts only `plan`.
- The reviewer digest is read from the worktree's project directory at
  launch: `sha256:…`, `none`, or empty for an attempt before the field.
- `R` asks three optional prompts after budget and mode, bound, model and
  effort, where Enter alone asks for nothing.
- Plan ready requires a clean, successful end of the latest attempt
  launched with `until: plan`, no open question and no candidate, the record
  readable and committed and the worktree clean; anything less ends without
  a handoff (review finding 1).

Per acceptance item:

1. Step 4 states the bound (with a pointer in Inputs), Lifecycle says a
   bounded assignment leaves the status as found, and step 6 names
   `grove-reviewer` and what the session passes it. Both adapters and init's
   `assignmentData` accept `--until plan` and still call any other bound,
   mode or text an error; the bound is passed to no command.
   `grove guide work` prints it. **Guides digest: `3c9996e33e42` at `98ce628`
   (recomputed from that commit's guides), `0c163c41a0f2` at `ccbb73c`.**
2. `grove run ID --until plan --model M --effort E` and `R` carry all three
   in the command (`/grove-work ID --until plan --interaction headless …
   --model M --effort E`). `attempt.json`, `grove attempt` (`Requested:` and
   `Cost by model:`) and the attempt screen (`Asked`, and the split in
   `Budget` when more than one model spent) show them beside the init's
   actual model. Without the options, the command and output are as before
   plus the `Requested:` fact. Tests: `TestInputsChanged`,
   `TestRunToResult`, `TestRefusals`, `TestAttemptCommandsUsage`,
   `TestLaunchFromTheDetail`, `TestAttemptScreenHonesty`.
3. With the fake provider: the command, launch fields, the board's
   plan-ready standing under Needs you and its superseded form
   (`TestAttemptOutcomes`, `TestAttemptStandings`), and the prompts in the
   pseudo-terminal script. With the real provider (Claude Code 2.1.282), in
   a disposable clone of `a84d01d` at `/tmp/g134-clone` (removed afterwards),
   on a fixture work record the clone numbered G-137 (the clone's own
   counter, not this repository's G-137):
   - A bounded attempt on `opus` at `medium` (`G-137.20260924T221429Z`) cost
     $0.46 over 1 minute. It committed plan G-138 with `work: ["G-137"]`,
     then a checkpoint in the record's Next naming the plan's path and
     revision and the continuation `/grove-work G-137 --interaction
     headless`. The record stayed `proposed`, and `git diff --stat
     main worktree-G-137` showed only `grove/`. Its init event listed
     `grove-reviewer` among the agents, so the provider loads the
     definition.
   - The real board, driven through a pseudo-terminal, listed it under Needs
     you as `plan ready: read it, then R`. The screen showed the requested
     bound, model and effort, the reviewer digest and the $0.46.
   - A second bounded run with nothing changed (`G-137.20260924T221651Z`,
     $0.26) returned the same checkpoint, wrote nothing, and left HEAD at
     `87be73f`.
   - `R` on the board then launched the implementation on the reused
     worktree from `87be73f`, with no `--until` (`G-137.20260924T221717Z`).
     It was stopped at once and cost $0.24.
   - Total real spend: $0.96. The screen draws of that last launch are
     recorded, but the driver's final wait missed a frame, so its facts come
     from `grove attempt`.
4. `init` writes `.claude/agents/grove-reviewer.md` with the managed marker,
   reported `created` then `unchanged` (`TestInitCreatesAProjectAndRerunsWithoutTouchingUserFiles`).
   The kept and updated verdicts use the same loop as the skills. Attempt
   facts show the digest or `no reviewer definition`.
5. Not in this candidate by its own terms: the experiment runs on the first
   real assignment after this lands, G-135, whose record reports it. The
   owner confirms that budget at assignment.
6. At `ccbb73c`, all passed: `go vet ./...`, `gofmt -l .` (empty),
   `go run ./cmd/grove check` (`OK: 132 records`),
   `go test -count=1 -timeout 120s ./...` (every package ok), and
   `python3 internal/tui/testdata/terminal.py` on a fresh build (11
   scenarios ok). Every relative link in the changed Markdown resolves.
   `./internal/attempt` alone ran in 4.7 s, close to the five-second rule;
   it was about 4.4 s before.

Review: [G-137](G-137-g-134-review-plan-bound-per-phas.md), two rounds by
an independent subagent given the `grove-reviewer` brief (the definition
could not be dispatched in a session that predates it). Round 1 had two
findings and two wording points, all fixed or kept as limits; round 2 had
none.

Limits:

- An attempt that ignores the bound and commits the record as `active`
  still reads as plan ready: the launch does not record the status it
  found.
- The reviewer is read-only for Bash by instruction only.
- Whether the provider applies an agent's `effort: high` was not observed:
  the result event's cost by model does not show effort.
- No review in this attempt ran through the definition itself.
- The installed `~/.local/bin/grove` lags until rebuilt.

## Next

In review with the candidate this record names. The integrator's actions:

1. Optionally, try it: `go run ./cmd/grove run G-NNN --until plan --budget 2
   --permission-mode auto --effort xhigh` on real work, then `A` on the
   board. Or read the clone evidence above.
2. `go run ./cmd/grove approve G-134 "VERDICT"` in this checkout
   (`.claude/worktrees/worktree-G-134`), then `go run ./cmd/grove integrate
   G-134` in the `main` checkout. Or `go run ./cmd/grove feedback G-134
   "TEXT"` here.
3. After integration, rebuild the installed binary and assign
   [G-135](G-135-run-the-g-108-eval-pair-on-codex.md) for acceptance 5's
   experiment: a bounded attempt on Opus 5.5 at `xhigh`, then the
   implementation at `medium`. It is reviewed through `grove-reviewer`, and
   the owner confirms the budget, proposed cap $30.

Follow-on, from before the assignment, still open: the bounded run as the
first work-row case of the G-108 evaluation suite; role profiles and a
second harness wait on G-135's report. [G-110](G-110-external-preview.md)
remains a poor first target for the experiment.

Verdict on candidate da8a936, 2026-09-24: approved
