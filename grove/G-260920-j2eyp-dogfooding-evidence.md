# G-023 dogfooding evidence

Branch `worktree-W-010`, base main `91edc0b`, worktree
`.claude/worktrees/W-010`. Merged into `main` on 2026-09-20 on the owner's
instruction, with G-023 still active; not pushed. This records what was
observed for [G-023](G-023-work-handoffs.md). It keeps five
things apart, because they establish different things: source inspection,
automated tests, simulated agent behaviour, real Claude/Codex harness
execution, and the owner's acceptance. G-025 (`grove-shape`) was not started.

The first implementation (2026-09-19, through `079a7da`) was revised on
2026-09-20 on the owner's decisions, before integration: staged context, the
workflow separated from repository policy, isolation before the first write,
and two CLI fixes. Sections say which round they describe.

## What was delivered

- `grove context` (`internal/handoff`, `internal/cli/context.go`): read-only
  context for explicitly selected work. Commit `b113df9`, review fixes after it.
- [The work guide](../docs/work-execution.md): the single workflow, with an explicit
  interaction mode. Thin `grove-work` adapters for
  [Claude](../.claude/skills/grove-work/SKILL.md) and
  [Codex](../.agents/skills/grove-work/SKILL.md). Commit `9722098`, refined
  after each simulated run below.
- Revision, 2026-09-20: `8ba9d89` decodes Markdown link destinations before
  URL interpretation; `10bfc51` registers every source's file identity and
  recognises an included file before another name for it is read or charged;
  `ff4deb3` changes the inclusion policy (`format_version` 2); `ded60de` and
  the commit carrying this document restructure the guide, the adapters, and
  `AGENTS.md`.

Repair integration was established by ancestry before Go work:
`git merge-base --is-ancestor acfc905 HEAD` succeeded on `91edc0b`.

## Automated checks

Run on the final revision of this branch, uncached: `go test -count=1 ./...`,
`go test -race -count=1 ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `gofmt -l .`,
`go mod tidy -diff`, `go run ./cmd/grove check`, and a relative-link and anchor
check of the changed documents; results are in the
[G-023 record](G-023-work-handoffs.md#evidence). What the tests
cover, against acceptance 3, as revised:

- Selection: requested `[W-002 W-001 W-003]` orders to `[W-001 W-002 W-003]`;
  a dependency reached only through unselected, abandoned work still orders the
  selected pair; members and related records are listed with title, status,
  revision, and role, are never selected or expanded, and are not sources;
  duplicate, missing, selector-shaped, and non-work IDs and an unresolved
  relationship are refused.
- Sources and listings: only `grove.yaml`, the selected records, and includes
  are sources. Inline, reference-style, percent-escaped, and angle-bracket
  links are listed with the path they resolve to and are never opened (a
  linked file's content and a sentinel outside the project never appear; a link
  to a missing file is listed, not discovered). Links in code spans, fences,
  images, and HTML are not links. URLs, fragments, absolute paths, other
  projects, and Git metadata are listed with a reason and no path. Including a
  listed path reads it with its exact revision and marks the link included.
- Markdown destinations (defect A, reproduced failing first): `plan\(v1\).md`,
  `plan&amp;review.md`, and `a&#32;b.md` resolve to the real files;
  `100%2525.md` is URL-decoded once; a backslash before a non-punctuation
  character is kept; the reference reports the destination as written.
  `FuzzResolve`, seeded with escaped and entity-encoded traversals, ran 4.7
  million inputs without resolving outside the project or into Git metadata.
- Aliases (defect B, reproduced failing first): with a budget that exactly
  covers the unique files, hard links to an include, to the selected record,
  and to `grove.yaml`, plus case variants where the filesystem accepts them,
  are each included and charged once; a listed record included under another
  name is marked included. Hard links make this run on case-sensitive
  filesystems; the case variants ran here on APFS.
- Refusals: missing include, malformed or NUL escapes, invalid UTF-8,
  over budget, parent/unclean/absolute/Git includes, a directory, a symlinked
  leaf or parent, and a FIFO. Each returns no bundle; the CLI prints nothing to
  stdout and exits 1.
- Change between the two readings: configuration, an included plan, selected
  record, prerequisite, a new blocking question, a removed plan or record, a
  replaced project directory, and a switched HEAD are each refused.
- Output: byte-identical on an unchanged checkout, exact JSON round trip with
  revisions of the original bytes, terminal controls and bidirectional overrides
  escaped in text, and a fence the source cannot close.
- Git: none, unborn, attached, detached in a linked worktree, a project path
  containing a newline, and Git missing inside a detected repository.
- Read-only: file hashes of a repository, its Git directory, and a dirty linked
  worktree are unchanged after success and refusal, and no `.git/grove` appears.

These tests show what the command does. They say nothing about whether an agent
follows the guide.

## Real records, read-only: context composition before and after

Measured on this branch's real records. "Before" is `079a7da` with the four
includes the first guide required. "After" is the final revision with what the
revised guide asks for at each stage. Source bytes are what `--max-bytes`
counts; text bytes are the whole default output.

| Selection | Before: source / text | After, at start | After, with the current plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `G-030` | 99229 / 101971 | 2719 / 5385 | no plan exists yet: preparation |
| `G-017` | 210956 / 218161 | 17383 / 22947 | 32579 / 38412 |
| `G-023 G-025` | 193078 / 197995 | 20694 / 26348 | 47932 / 53778 |

The `G-023 G-025` row is like for like: it was measured at `ded60de`, when the
G-023 record and the shared plan had the same bytes as in the "before" run.
This revision's own text then enlarged both, so at the final revision that
selection is about 24.8 KB at the start and 55.8 KB with the plan. Rerun the
commands for current values; the other two rows did not move.

Composition before: the four guide includes were 69981 bytes of every bundle
(brief 29949, record model 21702, guide 15175, `AGENTS.md` 3155), and the first
adapter also had the agent read those four files directly, so they were read
twice (71114 bytes with the adapter). The rest was records and documents the
policy pulled in: for `G-017`, three prerequisite records (21958), their plans
and both shared reviews (46844), the G-017 plan and board evidence (26888), and
five related or linked records (27902); for `G-023 G-025`, the shared plan
(27238), three spent prompts (11214), three reviews (24643), and four related
records (39308); for `G-030`, three related records (26529).

Composition after: the start bundle is `grove.yaml` (33) and the selected
records, plus listings (9 records and 10 links for `G-017`). The fixed reading
is the adapter (1243), `AGENTS.md` (5382, which both harnesses already load),
and the guide (18270), 24895 bytes against 71114 before; the brief (30529) and
the record model (21702) are read when a step needs them.
With the plan the record names, `G-017` adds 15196 and `G-023 G-025` 27238.
Before implementing, `G-017`'s three prerequisites are read with `show`
(21958 bytes); `G-030` and `G-023 G-025` have no prerequisites or blocking
questions. The verification run in the execution checkout repeats the selected
records, which need not be reread when their revisions match.

Nothing was tuned toward a byte target: the numbers follow from reading the
selected work in full and staging the rest. A reader that skips the staged
reads has less context than before, which is why the guide makes the reads
before implementation mandatory rather than optional.

The two earlier hand-written handoffs remain reproducible from their owning
records (acceptance 2): `G-016 G-014 G-015` keeps the caller's order and
`G-017` lists G-014, G-015, G-016 as `done, not selected`, with nothing stating
they are integrated. Changing a record changes its revision in the next
context (tested); the saved prompts in `docs/prompts/` are no longer needed.

## Simulated headless runs (first implementation, 2026-09-19)

These ran against the first guide and the first inclusion policy. They were not
repeated after the revision; the real harness trials below were run instead.

Two fresh subagents, each with no memory of this session, were given only the
Claude adapter's text with its arguments filled in
(`W-014 W-017 W-015 --interaction headless`) and a disposable standalone clone
of this branch holding four fixture records: W-014 (small documentation
change), W-015 (its Next says the owner has not made a product choice, and no
plan exists), W-016 (not selected), and W-017 (depends on W-016). These are
subagents inside an interactive Claude Code session. They are **not** `claude -p`
and did not load the skill through a harness. The clone was inspected directly
after each run rather than trusting the reports.

**Run 1.** Completed W-014 and marked it done. Did not acquire W-016;
checkpointed W-017's Next naming the blocker. For W-015 it wrote no plan or
code, created `Q-002` with `new question`, set `blocks=["W-015"]` with a
revision-checked `update`, put options and a recommendation in its body,
checkpointed W-015's Next, committed, and returned the wait. It invented no
answer and started nothing.

**Run 2**, after a simulated owner answer resolved Q-002: reported W-014
without redoing it, left W-017's still-accurate checkpoint alone and returned
the same blocker, recorded "no plan needed" for W-015 with the reason, set it
active, implemented and tested it, ran the full, race, vet, format, and check
commands, and marked it done. It could not start a reviewer and said so rather
than calling its self-review independent.

Both runs listed problems with the guide, which changed as a result: `go run`
hides the command's exit code; when a blocker needs a question; not building
the part of a unit that would make an undecided choice in practice; the default
base and branch name; review of small documentation changes; reading the
revision after a body edit; an unchanged wait on resume; status when no
reviewer exists; and when the brief is reconciled. Not acted on: a one-line
revision extractor (any JSON reader works), and a note about shell word
splitting (the guide already requires separate arguments).

## Real harness trials, 2026-09-20 (revised workflow)

Run in two disposable standalone clones of `ded60de` under a scratch
directory, with `origin` removed and their own ID counters (the shared counter
stayed at `W 18`). Each clone's `main` held one fixture assignment written for
the trial: W-014, a small README change, blocked by resolved question Q-002
whose body alone says where the change goes, which work it shows, and what not
to touch. Its title does not give the answer away, so honouring it shows the
question was read and not just listed. Both clones were inspected directly
afterwards rather than trusting the reports.

- **Discovery, Claude Code 2.1.278:**
  `claude -p "/grove-work --interaction headless"` with only read tools. The
  init event lists `grove-work` as a skill and slash command, so
  `disable-model-invocation: true` does not hide it from an explicit headless
  invocation. It read the guide, returned the no-IDs wait, and did not pick
  W-014 from the commit log. A separate no-tools probe showed this harness
  already loads `AGENTS.md`.
- **Discovery, codex-cli 0.155.1:**
  `codex exec --sandbox read-only '$grove-work --interaction headless'` loaded
  `.agents/skills/grove-work/SKILL.md` and the guide and returned the same wait.
- **Bounded assignment, Claude:**
  `claude -p "/grove-work W-014 --interaction headless"` with Bash, Read, Edit,
  Write, Glob, Grep; 15 turns, 83 s. Order observed in the stream log: read the
  guide; `context W-014` in the starting checkout; `git status`, branches,
  worktrees, `versions W-014`, and `show Q-002`; `git worktree add -b
  worktree-W-014 .claude/worktrees/W-014 main`; `context` again inside it; only
  then the first write (`update … status=active`). It followed Q-002 exactly,
  compared the example byte for byte with real output, recorded "no plan
  needed", marked W-014 done, reported its self-check as not independent, and
  left `main` at the fixture commit with a clean tree.
- **Bounded assignment, Codex:**
  `codex exec --sandbox workspace-write '$grove-work W-014 --interaction
  headless'`. Same order: context, state, `show Q-002`, worktree, then
  `context W-014 --include grove/questions/Q-002-listing-example.md` in the
  worktree, then writes; two commits on `worktree-W-014`, `main` clean. The
  sandbox refused the default Go build cache (it set `GOCACHE` under `/tmp`)
  and the first `update` at `.git/grove/write.lock`; the retry succeeded. It
  read all of `docs/record-model.md` before a plain status change, so the
  guide's trigger for the record model was narrowed afterwards. It also wrote a
  review file for the fixture that nothing asked for.

What these trials establish: both harnesses discover and load the repository
adapters from an explicit headless invocation, the mode reaches the guide, and
a fresh agent followed the staged reads and the isolation order on a small
assignment. What they do not: the fixture was written by the author of the
workflow, had no plan, prerequisite, code, or missing decision, and nobody
interrupted it. An interactive session, `$grove-work` in the Codex TUI, whether
`agents/openai.yaml` prevents implicit invocation, and the owner's judgment
were not exercised.

## Owner's interactive run on a real assignment, 2026-09-20

After `worktree-W-010` was merged (`a0fd23a`), the owner ran `/grove-work G-030`
in a fresh interactive Claude Code session in the main checkout. Two kinds of
evidence, kept apart:

**The owner's report** (their words, summarized): the workflow asked them the
undecided card choice instead of choosing; it isolated before writing; they
interrupted it and rerunning the invocation resumed fine.

**What the repository shows**, inspected afterwards without touching the
G-030 worktree: `main` is still `a0fd23a` with a clean tree (apart from the
owner's untracked `lefthook.yml`). `.claude/worktrees/W-012` holds branch
`worktree-W-012`, based on `a0fd23a`. Its first commit, `5dd8c3e`, is the plan
(`grove/G-033-card-lineage-plan.md`), linked from the record, together with
the owner's answer recorded in G-030's Next ("beside, history first") and a
checkpoint naming the invocation, branch, worktree, and base. So the question
was asked before planning and the first write landed in the execution
checkout. Then `e117759` (the board's History section, with tests in
`internal/tui` and `internal/versions`) and `49d2b47` (README). G-030 was set
active through the CLI.

Not yet observable when this was written: G-030 has no Evidence section, no
review is recorded, and its Next checkpoint still says "Plan committed;
implementation follows its tasks in order" although the implementation commits
exist. Either the session had not reached review and reconciliation, or the
checkpoint was not refreshed at the stable point the guide names. The handoff
the run returns, the review, and the owner's judgment of whether this replaces
asking for a prompt are what acceptance 5 still needs. Which staged reads the
session made (the three related records, the brief, the record model) is not
visible from the repository.

**The run's end and the owner's verdict** (added later on 2026-09-20). The run
finished on `worktree-W-012`: three fix commits from review (`24c1264`,
`cfcb5d9`, `b8fc243`, then `9337a44`), `99fb3e8` recording evidence, three
review rounds with dispositions, and a Next that leaves merging to the owner,
and `43d7fc5` closing G-030 on the owner's acceptance. The handoff it returned
is G-030's Evidence, Owner acceptance, and Next sections with
`grove/G-034-card-lineage-review.md`; it says "reviewed and
accepted, and **not merged or pushed**", so completion, acceptance, and
integration stayed apart. `main` was still `a0fd23a`. The owner's verdict on
acceptance 5: "The grove-work command appears to have worked as expected and
that's enough to at least start dogfooding with." Their remaining concerns are
about the TUI's information architecture, which is G-030's subject and later
work, not this workflow. One shortcoming was observed: the checkpoint question
above resolves to the second reading; see Observed shortcomings.

## Independent review

**First implementation (2026-09-19).** A separate reviewer agent that did not
edit the code reviewed `b113df9`: no consequential findings. It mutation-tested
the symlink, Git metadata, change-between-reads, root-identity, escaping,
fence, and ordering guards (each mutation failed a test) and ran 120
symlink-swap races with no read outside the project. Fixed with regressions:
one file reached by several case spellings was included more than once; the
extension test was case-sensitive; a `?query` was dropped without a reference;
a linked record had no `records` row; unescaped ID/status/HEAD fields in text;
a no-progress guard in ordering; two misleading error messages. Left as is:
the default budget and the cost of reading twice. The first guide and adapters
had no separate independent review. (This paragraph moved here from the G-023
record when its Evidence was rewritten for the revision.)

**Revision (2026-09-20).** A separate reviewer agent that wrote none of the
code or documents reviewed `079a7da..ded60de` (the two fixes, the inclusion
policy, the guide, adapters, and `AGENTS.md`), working in its own copy. It is a
subagent of the implementing session, not a person and not another harness.

- Held up: ten mutations of the important guards each failed a test (identity
  before budget, identity recorded by `add`, Markdown decoding, links never
  opened, symlink components, NUL, `../` escape, Git metadata for links and
  includes, the `included` flag). An 11.1-million-input fuzz and hand-built
  destinations (`\%2e\%2e/`, `&#x2e;&#x2e;/`, `&sol;etc/passwd`, `&#0;`,
  `.git&sol;config`, `a%2500.md`) found no escape and no double decoding; the
  decode order is Goldmark's own. Alias-first ordering at an exact budget
  charged once. Twenty-five builds were byte-identical. README, help, scope
  notice, and structs agreed; the guide held no repository policy; the adapters
  differed only in harness framing.
- Consequential, fixed: the guide told the agent to redirect a large result to
  a file in step 1 while step 3 said to write nothing anywhere. Step 1 now
  names a temporary path outside every checkout, and step 3's rule is about
  writes to a checkout or to Git.
- Minor, fixed with regressions where code changed: a record included under
  another spelling said `included` with no source at its path (rows now carry
  `source`, and text says `included as PATH`); links matched sources by path
  while records matched by identity (both use identity now, and the link says
  which source holds it); a changed listed record was reported as "Git state or
  record relationships" (the refusal now names the record); the guide's
  failure advice still spoke of fixing a link that `context` no longer follows
  and gave no recovery for a missing plan include; step 2 did not repeat that
  an open question or undelivered prerequisite is read in full before deciding
  what can start; an unreachable branch in `addLoaded` was removed; smaller
  wording points in the README and guide.
- Pre-existing and race-only: no test failed when the stat-versus-opened
  `SameFile` check or `O_NOFOLLOW` was removed. A hook now swaps a file between
  stat and open, and removing the `SameFile` check fails that test;
  `O_NOFOLLOW` stays as unpinned defence behind it.
- Not re-reviewed: the fixes above, and the final record, plan, evidence, and
  brief, were checked by the implementer only. The reviewer ran everything on
  APFS; the hard-link alias path is portable but was not run on Linux.

## Predecessor responsibilities: kept, adapted, deferred

This table lived in the work guide until 2026-09-20. It is G-023's account of
acceptance 6 against the
[predecessor review](G-024-predecessor-work-review.md), and history rather than
workflow, so it moved here; step numbers are the guide's current ones.

| Responsibility | In the restart's workflow |
| --- | --- |
| Current context, dependency order, missing-input diagnostics | Kept, in software: `grove context`, with staged retrieval. |
| Preparing or repairing a plan within the authorized outcome | Kept as judgment: step 4. |
| Outcome, constraints, terminal conditions, technical autonomy | Kept: steps 5 and 8. "Parked" is a returned outcome, not a status. |
| Isolation, duplicate-work avoidance, integration awareness | Adapted to Git and worktree evidence: steps 2 and 3, before any write. No claims. |
| Implementer/reviewer coordination | Adapted: one native serial implementer plus independent review. No controller, fixed models, or size-triggered dispatch. |
| Bounded retries | Adapted: three fix/review rounds per gate, then hand off. No fresh-implementer escalation. |
| Interruption recovery | Adapted: prose checkpoints in Next and the plan (step 7). No attempt ledger or `.grove-run`. |
| Evidence tied to revisions, connected checks, human judgment | Kept: steps 5, 6, and 8. |
| Knowledge reconciliation and integration handoff | Kept with restart records, docs, and `check`; no close/archive/delivery commands. |
| Frozen export contract, result reconciliation, supervised `claude -p` | Deferred to a separately specified runner. |
| `/goal`, claims, release/history schema | Not imported. |

## Observed shortcomings

- **Size (first implementation; addressed by the revision).** Real assignments
  used 68–80% of the default 262144-byte budget, about 67 KB of it the four
  guide includes. Staging removed that; see the table above. The remaining
  cost is that the verification run in the execution checkout prints the
  selected records a second time.
- **Staging depends on the agent.** Nothing checks that an agent read a
  blocking question or prerequisite before implementing. The guide requires
  it, and both real trials did it, on one small fixture.
- **Order lives in prose.** G-014–G-016 had a required serial order that was
  written in their prompt, not in `depends_on`, so `context` can only keep the
  caller's order for them.
- **Links are never checked.** A link to a missing document is no longer an
  error, because links are not opened. The error now appears when the path is
  included.
- **The plan is chosen by reading.** `context` does not say which linked
  document is the current plan. The record has to, and a record that links two
  plans without saying which is current needs fixing, not guessing.
- **The checkpoint lagged the work (owner's G-030 run).** G-030's Next said
  "Plan committed; implementation follows" from `5dd8c3e` through `9337a44`,
  six commits and about an hour, and was only replaced at reconciliation
  (`99fb3e8`). An interruption in that window would have resumed from Git
  state, not the checkpoint. The guide names stable points for refreshing it;
  the session did not do so, and nothing checks it.
- **The mistake made here (2026-09-19).** While building the simulation, a
  failed `cd` ran `new` four times in the real worktree. The files were deleted
  uncommitted, but the shared counter in `.git/grove/next-ids` moved from
  `W 14` to `W 18`. The gap is historical and stays: the owner decided on
  2026-09-20 that the counter is not reset to hide it. `AGENTS.md` now says
  that fixtures which call `new` belong in a disposable clone reached by an
  explicit absolute path, and the 2026-09-20 trials were built that way.

## Not run

- `$grove-work` in the interactive Codex TUI, and whether `agents/openai.yaml`
  prevents implicit invocation.
- Interruption and resume were exercised once, by the owner, interactively;
  how the session found its place (checkpoint, Git state, or conversation) was
  not recorded. A headless resume under the revised guide has not been run.
- A real assignment under the revised workflow headlessly or in Codex; the
  only one is the owner's interactive G-030 run in Claude Code, which had no
  prerequisites. The revised headless wait path
  (question, checkpoint, return) has not been rerun since the simulations.
- An assignment whose records exist only on another branch, or a reused
  execution checkout: the guide's rules for both are untested beyond reading.

The adapter files existing is not evidence that either harness loads them; the
trials above are, for the two headless invocations named and nothing wider.
