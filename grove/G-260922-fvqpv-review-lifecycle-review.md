## Examined

Independent review of [G-038](G-038-review-lifecycle.md) against its
acceptance and the plan [G-073](G-073-review-lifecycle-plan.md), by a
reviewer session with no write access to the checkout, on 2026-09-22.
Round 1 examined `f9f6c0d` on `worktree-G-038` (diff from main `a28a24b`);
round 2 examined the fix commit `12b7752`; round 3 examined `4109c95`,
the value of `examined`. The reviewer mutation-tested both
new rules in a scratch copy: forcing `integrated` to return nil fails
`TestUpdateDoneMeansAnIntegratedCandidate`, and removing the
required-in-review branch fails `TestReviewLifecycleAndCandidate`.

## Findings

Round 1, consequential:

1. `update` refused `done` only where HEAD lacked the candidate, so on the
   work branch, where the candidate is an ancestor too, `done` was accepted;
   the record model, guide, README, AGENTS.md, the plan and the code comment
   all said it was refused there. Reproduced in a disposable project.
2. `context` printed "done without a candidate is not integration" above
   Requirements lines that carried no candidate, so a reader could not tell
   the two apart.
3. The G-038 record had no Evidence and a stale Next, so acceptance 2 was not
   met as the branch stood.
4. The plan said `candidate` is refused while `proposed`; the code allows it.
5. The README said "a `review` record" where it meant a work record in
   Review status, the distinction the term G-058 draws in the same commit.

Round 1, minor:

6. A reopened record could be closed again on its old candidate; only the
   guide's `git diff --stat CANDIDATE TIP` check catches it, and the record
   model's not-enforced list did not say so.
7. `--unset candidate` on a done record gave the "set candidate=COMMIT" advice.
8. An unknown commit and a genuine non-ancestor shared one message.
9. No test proved a letters-only candidate stays a quoted string.
10. The narrow tab names were a hand-sized array indexed over the statuses.
11. The plan promised a connected terminal check at 100 and 80 columns; the
    diff widened the connected test to 160 instead, and five columns at 100
    cells truncate titles sooner.
12. The brief still says Done "will" mean integrated and that G-038 "must"
    migrate it.

Acceptance as the reviewer read it at `f9f6c0d`: 1, 4 and 5 met; 3 met in
substance with the enforcement gap in finding 6 stated as guidance; 2 not met
(finding 3); 6 partly, pending the evidence transcript.

## Disposition

Fixed in `12b7752`: finding 1 by rewording the six places to what the check
enforces, that a checkout without the code cannot close the work, with the
target rule named as the guide's and AGENTS.md's, plus a test that the
on-branch write is accepted; 2 by a `candidate` field on `Requirement`,
rendered as `done, candidate COMMIT` or `done, no candidate`; 4 and 5 by
text; 6 by a line in the not-enforced list; 7 and 8 by separate messages
(`a record that stays done cannot lose its candidate`; Git's exit 1 is reported as
not an ancestor, anything else as could not be checked), each with a test;
9 by a quoting test; 10 by an array sized from the status count.

Finding 3 is the evidence and Next written into G-038 with the handoff.
Finding 11: the 100- and 80-column checks were run on a pseudo-terminal and
are in G-038's evidence; the truncation is reported there for the owner, and
G-043 owns the visual redesign. Finding 12 is left for the owner: AGENTS.md
reserves the brief for direction changes, not progress.

Round 2, on `12b7752`, consequential: (13) the round-1 fix for finding 2
printed `done, candidate` for a prerequisite with no candidate, and no test
rendered a Requirements line; (14) the record model said "a done record's
candidate cannot be removed", but reopening with `--unset candidate` in the
same call is allowed, so the enforced rule is that a record that stays done
cannot lose it. Minor: (15) closing from review while unsetting the candidate
got the removal message instead of the advice to set one; (16) the JSON
comment on `Requirement.Candidate` said "merged" though a review
prerequisite's candidate is only offered; (17) a Git warning beside exit 1
(a branch named like a hex commit) would get the "could not be checked"
wording, cosmetic and still a refusal; (18) the tab-name array and its
comment; (19) a test scoping hack. Round 2 confirmed every round-1 fix
closed and the fixture sound.

Fixed in `4109c95`: 13 by an explicit branch; 14 by the sentence; 15 by
guarding on the prior status, with a test; 16 and 18 by the comments; 19 by
a plain block. 17 left as cosmetic.

Round 3, on `4109c95`, consequential: (20) the render fix for 13 shipped
without the test the previous paragraph had credited to it, because the
implementer's edit script aborted before appending it and the claim was
written anyway; the reviewer proved by mutation that the old bug left the
suite green. (21) This record carried a literal round-3 placeholder. Minor:
(22) the reopening test step duplicates earlier coverage; (23) the
`Requirement.Candidate` comment omitted the reopened case; (24) `examined`
named only the first round's commit. Round 3 confirmed the update guard by
mutation, the review-to-done test step as load-bearing, and the record
model's sentence as exact.

Fixed in the commit after `4109c95`, after the third round and therefore
self-checked, not independently reviewed: 20 by adding
`TestRequirementsNameADoneCandidateOrItsAbsence`, which the implementer
showed failing against the old bug and passing against the fix; 21 and 24
by this text and `examined`; 23 by the comment. 22 kept as documentation.
